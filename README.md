# ðŸ¦  Disease Outbreak Tracking on Aptos Blockchain

## ðŸ“„ Description

This Move module, `DiseaseOutbreakTracking`, is designed to securely report and manage disease outbreak data on the Aptos blockchain. It allows authorized health authorities to:

- Report new outbreaks
- Update existing outbreak information
- Track vital outbreak statistics such as confirmed cases, suspected cases, deaths, and status

By leveraging the transparency and immutability of blockchain, this system ensures that disease outbreak data remains tamper-proof, auditable, and always available.

## ðŸš€ Future Scope

- âœ… Integration with **decentralized identity (DID)** to authenticate health authorities  
- âœ… Incorporate **geolocation standards** for consistent outbreak tracking across regions  
- âœ… Build a **frontend dashboard** to visualize active and historical outbreak data  
- âœ… Enable **multi-authority collaboration** on single outbreak entries  
- âœ… Add **data analytics and trend prediction** using machine learning on-chain/off-chain
